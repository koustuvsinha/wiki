# Dynamic URLs using routeParams

What if you have a lot of users posting _things_ to your website? Maybe your users want to have a profile, or a wall, of the _things_ they've posted, and they want to be able to share it with their friends with a url? You can do that, no biggie!

##  

Let's say you used

```bash
>> yo angular-fullstack:route wall
```

to generate a [http://myapp.wherever.com/wall/](#) route for your users. You want a link to [http://myapp.wherever.com/wall/someUsername](#) to show a specific user's _things_.<br>Browse to **/client/app/wall/wall.js** and notice that it detects what URL the user is requesting before acting on it:  

```javascript
$routeProvider.when('/wall', …
```

You can customize that path to catch when a user is trying to see a profile associated with a specific username like so:  

```javascript
$routeProvider.when('/wall/:username', …
```

The colon before "username" indicates that this is a variable, which is then passed to the _$routeParams_ module. In **wall.controller.js**, include _$routeParams_:  

```javascript
.controller('WallCtrl', function ($scope, $routeParams) { …
```

Then later on in **wall.controller.js**, you can see what username was requested in the URL by referring to the variable generated by _$routeProvider_ using something like  

```javascript
var wallOwner = $routeParams.username;
```
