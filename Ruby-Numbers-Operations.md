# Ruby Numbers Operations

In Ruby you can perform all standard math operations on numbers, including: addition `+`, subtraction `-`, multiplication `*`, division `/`, find remainders `%`, and work with exponents `**`.

## Addition:

- Numbers can be added together using the `+` operator.

```ruby
15 + 25
# returns:
40
```

## Subtraction:

- Numbers can be subtracted from one another using the `-` operator.

```ruby
25 - 15
# returns:
10
```

## Multiplication:

- Numbers can be multiplied together using the `*` operator.

```ruby
10 * 5
# returns:
50
```

## Division:

- Numbers can be divided by one another using the `/` operator.

```ruby
10 / 5
# returns:
2
```

## Remainders:

- Remainders can be found using the modulus `%` operator.

```ruby
10 % 3
# returns:
1 # because the remainder of 10/3 is 1
```

## Exponents:

- Exponents can be calculated using the `**` operator.

```ruby
2 ** 3
# returns:
8 # because 2 to the third power, or 2 * 2 * 2 = 8
```
