# Java Loop Control Statements

Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.

Java supports the following control statements:

- [break](Java-Loops-Control-Statement-Break)
- [continue](Java-Loops-Control-Statement-Continue)
