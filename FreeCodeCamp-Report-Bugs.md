# How to Report a Bug

Thank you for taking the effort to report an issue with FreeCodeCamp.

If you think you've found a bug on FreeCodeCamp, please follow these steps to resolve your problem:

1. If the page seems broken in any way, try to do a [Hard Refresh](Refresh-Your-Browser-Cache) of the page. This will update any old code that may have been cached in your browser.

  - If your code crashes your browser, also try [Clearing Your Browser's Local Storage](FreeCodeCamp-Clear-Your-Browser-Local-Storage).

2. [Ask for Help on Gitter](FreeCodeCamp-Gitter-Help). You can usually get a quick response from a helpful community member there.

3. If your problem has baffled everyone in Gitter, try [Searching for Your Issue on GitHub](Search-Existing-Issue) for anyone who has posted about a similar issue. If someone has, you can upvote the issue by replying to it with "+1" as your message.

4. If you can't find any relevant issues on GitHub, then [Create a New Issue](Creating-A-New-Github-Issue) and our development team will take a look at your problem.
