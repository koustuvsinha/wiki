## Using the Wiki

The Free Code Camp wiki exists to provide clear answers to common questions about Free Code Camp, learning to code, and getting a coding job. Please feel free to add relevant content to the wiki. Just be sure to search for a topic and see if it already exists before starting a new page.

Individual Wikis can be accessed from the main page, or from other linked wiki pages.

You can also access wiki pages from Gitter using Camperbot:

- **`help $topic`**

  Finds related materials to that topic, usually a page from the [wiki](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/freecodecamp/wiki). Examples:   
   `help css`   
   `help bootstrap`

- **`topics`**

  Shows the list of topics.

- **`find $topic`**

  This will search for entries that include `$topic` in the title. Example:   
  `find wiki`

## Contribution Guides

We currently have a couple of guides to help you contribute, via the browser, command line, or desktop application.

- [How to Contribute from Your Browser](Wiki-Contribute-Online): This is currently the easiest way we have to contribute. A simplified version can also be found in the Medium post "[How to land your first open source contribution, from your browser, in 15 minutes](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/how-to-land-your-first-open-source-contribution-from-your-browser-in-15-minutes-756d9bbf81ad)."
- [How to Fork Our wiki](Wiki-Contribute-Fork): This shows you how to fork our wiki and keep your fork synchronized.
- [How to Contribute to the Wiki Locally](Wiki-Contribute-Local-GUI): This guide shows you how to make changes to the wiki from a local copy on your computer; it also works for contributing to the main repository.
- [Pull Request Guidelines](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE)
- [More on How to Make a Pull Request from a Fork](Pull-Request-Contribute)
- [How to Squash Commits](Git-Squash): We require only one commit per pull request, unless otherwise specified by a moderator.
- [Create markdown articles using atom](Wiki-Create-Articles-With-Atom): this guide will help you write articles with atoma nd its markdown previwer.

### Labels

Before creating your first pull request or starting your work as an issue moderator, it is strongly suggested that you get familiar with the [labels guide](Wiki-Labels-Guide). This will provide you with a through understanding on our labeling system so you can use it properly and maintain a stable workflow.

For a list of labels used globally throughout FreeCodeCamp’s repositories, consult the guide "[Select Issues for Contributing Using Labels](FreeCodeCamp-Issue-Labels)."

### Issues

Creating issues in general is simpler than creating a pull request.

- [Creating a New Github Issue](Creating-A-New-Github-Issue)
- [Searching for Your Issue on Github](Search-Existing-Issue)

### Moderators

If you are really committed to contributing to the wiki and  would like to join the team and be able to merge pull requests, create new labels, assign mods to specific pull requests, and more, then just check the [requirements to become a wiki mod](Wiki-Become-A-Mod) and follow the instructions.

[**Improve someone’s pull request**](Wiki-Improve-PR): At some point while managing the influx of pull requests, you will be faced with a choice between letting an old contribution die out because the improvements needed have not been applied, or improving the contribution yourself while also keeping the initial contributor’s work. The latter is often the best choice.

### Translation

We aim to translate all our articles into as many languages as we can support. For this, we need people willing to collaborate and translate articles. We have a series of articles that will help you get started and solve any issues:

- [**Translation Guides**](Translation-Guide)

## Templates

We have a few templates for different aspects of the wiki, such as different articles and fixed information to help contribute.

### Article Templates

These templates guide the creation of new articles such as algorithm challenges and informational articles.

- [JavaScript Articles](Wiki-Template-JavaScript)
- [Challenge Solutions](Wiki-Template-Challenge-Solution)

### Contribution Templates

These templates are visible when you are trying to contribute to the Wiki. They provide useful information, guides, and guidelines that you must follow to ensure a proper contribution.

- [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING)
- [Pull Request](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE)
