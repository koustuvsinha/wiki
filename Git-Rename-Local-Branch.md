# Rename local branches in Git

To rename a local branch, enter the following into the terminal:
> `-m` stands for move, just like `mv` is used in linux to rename files.

```bash
git branch -m <oldname> <newname>
```

If you have already checked out the branch you want to change:
```bash
git branch -m <newname>
```

Here is an example of renaming the `feature/react-challenges` branch to `fix/react-hikes` from FreeCodeCamp:
```bash
git checkout feature/react-challenges
git branch -m fix/react-hikes
```
