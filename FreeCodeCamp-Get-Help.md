# How To Get Help When You Are Stuck

When you get stuck, remember: Read-Search-Ask.

2. **Search** Google
3. **Ask** your friends for help

This is the most time-efficient way to handle being stuck, and it's the most respectful of other people's time, too.

Most of the time, you'll solve your problem after just one or two steps of this algorithm.

We have a special chat room just for getting help: [https://gitter.im/freecodecamp/help/](https://gitter.im/freecodecamp/help/)

Camper Bianca Mihai has also written a 3 article series on what she does when she gets stuck:

[How to start when you are stuck (I)](How-To-Start-When-Stuck-I)

[How to start when you are stuck (II)](How-To-Start-When-Stuck-II)

[How to start when you are stuck (III)](How-To-Start-When-Stuck-III)

Learning to code is hard. But it's a lot easier if you ask for help when you need it!
