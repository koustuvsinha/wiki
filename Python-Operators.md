**Operators** are the constructs which can manipulate the value of operands.

Consider the expression `4 + 5 = 9`. Here, `4` and `5` are called _operands_ and `+` is called _operator_.

## Types of Operator

Python language supports the following types of operators.

- Arithmetic Operators
- Comparison (Relational) Operators
- Assignment Operators
- Logical Operators
- Bitwise Operators
- Membership Operators
- Identity Operators

We shall be covering a few more in-built types [next](Python-More-Builtin-Types).
