# Free Code Camp

Free Code Camp is an open source community. We have a free, self-paced web development curriculum located at [http://freecodecamp.com](http://freecodecamp.com), but we are much larger than just that.

We leverage the power of these existing platforms to connect with one another and learn to code together:
