# Create Pull requests to add the Translations to code base.

As mentioned [earlier](Translation-Translate), a [Pull Request](FreeCodeCamp-Guide-Pull-Request) or PR is a method of submitting proposed changes to the code base.

Afterwards, from the web page of your fork in github.com, make a _pull request_ to the branch called `staging` in the main repository (see the [help](Pull-Request-Contribute)). Add "Closes #yyyy" to the description area in the Pull request where `yyyy` is the issue number of the original issue that was created for the challenge translation. Doing this will automatically close the open issue when the PR is merged.
