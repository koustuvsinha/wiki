[Gitter.im](https://gitter.im) is a rapidly growing startup based in London.

Free Code Camp has hundreds of Gitter rooms. These are accessible through Gitter's website, as well as [desktop and mobile apps](https://gitter.im/apps).

You can view [all of our rooms](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/Official-Free-Code-Camp-Chat-Rooms) and join the ones you'd like to.

Gitter allows you to share [formatted code](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/freecodecamp/wiki/Pasting-Code-in-Gitter) with fellow campers.
