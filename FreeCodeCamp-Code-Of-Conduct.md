# Free Code Camp Code of Conduct

Free Code Camp is friendly place to learn to code. We're committed to keeping it that way.

All campers are required to agree to and follow this code of conduct.

In short: be nice. No harassment, trolling, or spamming.

- Harassment includes sexual language and imagery, deliberate intimidation, stalking, unwelcome sexual attention, libel, and any malicious hacking or social engineering. Free Code Camp should be a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, national origin, or religion (or lack thereof).

- Trolling includes posting inflamitory comments to provoke an emotional response or disrupt discussions.

- Spamming includes posting off-topic messages to disrupt discussions or promote a product.

If you see someone harass, troll, or spam anywhere on Free Code Camp's online media (Gitter, YouTube, Facebook, etc.), notify us in [gitter.im/freecodecamp/admin](https://gitter.im/freecodecamp/admin) - preferably with a screen shot of the offense. Our team will take any action we deem appropriate, up to and including banning the offender from Free Code Camp.

Also, no bots are allowed in any of of our [official chat rooms](https://www.freecodecamp.com/wiki/en/official-free-code-camp-chat-rooms/) without prior written permission from [Free Code Camp's Core Team](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/CoreTeam).

If you have questions about this code of conduct, email us at [team@freecodecamp.com](mailto:team@freecodecamp.com).
