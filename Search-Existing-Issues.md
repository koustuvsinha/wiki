# Searching for Existing Issues

If you still see problems after [Getting Help on Gitter](FreeCodeCamp-Gitter-Help), you will want to try to see if anyone else has posted about a similar problem.

1. Go to FreeCodeCamp's [Github Issues](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/issues) page.

2. Use the search bar to search for already filed issues that may be related to your problem.

  - If you find one, read it! You can subscribe to get updates about that specific issue by clicking on `Subscribe` in the sidebar. You can also comment on the issue if you have something to add.
  - If you cannot find any relevant issues you should [Create a New Github Issue](Creating-A-New-Github-Issue).
