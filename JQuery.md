# jQuery

It's the most used library in JavaScript. Is used to handle events, create animations, etc. to create dynamic web applications and pages.

- `$()` -> tells js we'll be using jQuery.
- `document` tells jQuery to work with our HTML
- `.ready` -> makes the jQuery wait untill the page is completely loaded.
