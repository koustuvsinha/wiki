Free Code Camp Study Groups represent a localized experience of our community, and they are entirely run and organised by people like you who are devoted to learning how to code and helping others do so. Their Facebook sites are the place to organize Coffee-and-Code style events, pair-program locally in hack sessions, or share news about other coding-related events in your area. They are meant to gather people within 15-20 minutes of each other.

Whether you live in a major metropolitan area, or a small town, we encourage you to join or create your own group to meet other busy people learning to code.
