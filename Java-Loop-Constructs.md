# Java Loop constructs

Remember that one friend who goes on and on about something? Well, that's a `loop` right there for you. In `Java`, a developer can represent the action of `doing something repeatedly` using the following constructs:

- [`while` Loop](Java-Loops-While)
- [`for` Loop](Java-Loops-For)
- [`do..while` Loop](Java-Loops-Do-While)
