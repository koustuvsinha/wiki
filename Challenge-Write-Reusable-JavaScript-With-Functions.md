# Challenge Write Reusable JavaScript with Functions

In JavaScript, we can divide up our code into reusable parts called functions.

Here's an example of a function:

```javascript

function functionName() {
  console.log("Hello World");
}
```

You can `call` or `invoke` this function by using its name followed by parentheses, like this:

```javascript
functionName();
```

Each time the function is called it will print out the message "Hello World" on the dev console. All of the code between the curly braces will be executed every time the function is called.

Here is another example:

```javascript
function otherFunctionName (a, b) {
    return(a + b);
}
```

We can `call` or `invoke` our function like this:

```javascript
otherFunctionName(1,2);
```

and it will run and return its return value to us.
